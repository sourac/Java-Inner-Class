/*inner class in java is a security mechanism.
 * As we know if a class is private it cannot be inherited.so mostly class are made public
 * instead of private but classes can be made private if the class is member of another class.
 * then the inner class can be made private.
 * And then it is used to access private member of class.
 * 
 * Inner classes are of three types:
 * 1. inner class
 * 2. local inner class
 * 3. Anonymous inner class 
 * */

/*
 * Inner class creation is the simplest task.
 * we just need to create a class within a class
 * and an inner class can be made private and once declared private inner clalss cannor be accessed
 * by object of outside class.
